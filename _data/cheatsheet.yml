      Most job postings feel routine. 
      This one felt like the Universe knocking. 

      I read _REWORK_ during a time of deep uncertainty and reflection about my career. I’d spent recent years designing for startups, trying to make a difference. To no avail. 
      Fruitless. Depleting. Discouraging. 

      Your book reminded me what meaningful work can feel like. My gut had been right all along—doing meaningful work without compromising on values is possible. I felt like I’d made new friends, instantly. And the more I learned about 37signals from the _REWORK_ podcast, the stronger that feeling grew: these are the people I want to work with.

      I’ve been hoping for an opportunity like this for a long time.
