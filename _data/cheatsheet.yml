      Most job postings feel routine.  
      This one felt like the Universe knocking. 

      I read _REWORK_ during a time of deep uncertainty and reflection about my career. I’d spent recent years designing for startups, trying to make a difference. To no avail.   
      Fruitless. Depleting. Discouraging. 

      Your book reminded me what meaningful work can feel like. My gut had been right all along—doing meaningful work without compromising on values is possible. I felt like I’d made new friends, instantly. From that moment on, with everything I learned about 37signals, my desire to join your team only grew stronger.

      I’ve been quietly waiting for an opportunity like this.   
      Now I can say “hell yeah!” and get to writing.


  - signal: "We're looking for a designer, not a decorator. A product builder, not a picture maker. A shipper, not a prototyper. At many companies, product design is split into different roles: UX, UI, front-end development, copywriter, etc. At 37signals, it’s all one role. This means our designers are exceptional generalists."

      I look at products as a whole.  
      I ask questions. I talk to customers. I seek context.  
      I enjoy shipping work—from concept to finished product.  
      I shape ideas. I draw interfaces. I write copy. I build.  
      Start to finish. 

      Most companies want you to fit the box. Stick to one thing.  
      Screw that. 

      I thrive as a generalist.

  - signal: "Along with having great visual taste and sensibilities, you must be able to write your own production-quality front-end HTML, CSS, and English."
    response: |
      A checkbox—with an asterisk.  
      The asterisk: it’s been a while since I last shipped production-ready front-end code.

      Just to be sure I still had it, I wrote and deployed this cover letter as a  [GitHub page](https://rslnk.github.io/dear-37signals/).

  - signal: "We believe the best designs come from someone who can see it all through, from ideas to visuals to the finished product."
    response: |
      I believe that too.  
      Start to finish.  
      Not just thinking. Not just implementing.  
      All of it.
